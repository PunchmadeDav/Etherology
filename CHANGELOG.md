## Added
- Now Tuning Fork can load chunks while resonating, so it is possible to create a distant "network" of Tuning Forks (#9).

## Fixed
- Incompatibilities with Sinytra Connector, Fusion, SuperMartijn642's Core, and Config lib (#30 and #32).
- Now Blacksmith doesn't sell Traditional Pattern twice (#7).
- Trident duplication bug (#29).
- Ethril and Ebony armor trims bug (#31).
- Crash on mixing items in Brewing Cauldron (#33).
- Aspects not loading on first item mixing.
- Now Attrahite is more common.

## Note
Incompatibility with Sinytra Connector has been fixed, but Neoforge support is unofficial, so you may encounter bugs and crashes.
